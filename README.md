# leaflet-challenge
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS provides scientific data about natural hazards, ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate change.
In this challenge we built tools to aid in the visualisation of earthquake data. 
We used Data Visualization using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and GeoJSON
In Leaflet Part 1 of this Activity we used an earthquake dataset from a GeoJSON feed provided and transformed the data into a map which shows earthquakes by their magnitude
