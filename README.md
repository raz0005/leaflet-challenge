# leaflet-challenge
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS provides scientific data about natural hazards, ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate change.

In Leaflet Part 1 of this Activity we used an earthquake dataset from a GeoJSON feed provided and transformed the data into a map which shows earthquakes by their magnitude

We visualized our data using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and GeoJSON.

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. 

Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. 

Clicking on an earthquake marker will produce popups that provide additional information about the earthquake, like location/date & time/magnitude/etc
